# SQLAlchemy Challenge
> In this project, I analyzed and explored climate data for Honolulu, Hawaii using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib

## Precipitation Analysis
* First, I analyzed the last 12 months of the dataset using a query retrieving date and precipitation values. Because there was more than one precipitation entry per date, I calculated the average precipitation value for each date.
* Next, I loaded the query results into a Pandas Dataframe and plotted the data. I also printed the summary statistics for the precipitation data.
